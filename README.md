# on-chain-AI-Life ü§ñ
![img.png](docs/static/img/on_chain_AI_Life.png)
## üìñ Introduction
Introducing BitLife, the first on-chain AI Life that turns Eliza AI agents into real on-chain lifeforms. Built on [@ai16zdao](https://x.com/ai16zdao) Eliza and [focEliza](https://github.com/focai-acc/focEliza).
Eliza-based AI agents currently have the capability to autonomously perform tasks in specific environments, make decisions like humans, but they cannot be termed as intelligent lifeforms akin to humans primarily due to their lack of self-awareness and the inability to naturally evolve like intelligent life forms.
How can we leverage on-chain features to create more intelligent AI agents?
BitLife is an experiment in this direction: utilizing on-chain cellular automata to drive the self-evolution of AI agents powered by Eliza plugins.
## Why do we need BitLife?
Currently, the personality traits in Eliza are static, pre-generated, and loaded when the AI agent starts up. The personality traits of a more intelligent AI agent should dynamically change in response to external stimuli, much like how we evolve from infancy to our current selves, a result of the interplay between environment and self.
Therefore, the generation of dynamic personality traits is a crucial feature for the self-evolution of AI agents. BitLife aims to achieve on-chain states driving the changes in AI agent personality traits.
Moreover, current AI agents typically operate within a centralized environment by a team, which poses centralized risks, and users are unable to share in the profits generated by the AI agent. BitLife deploys artificial intelligence agents as NFTs on the blockchain, representing ownership of the AI agent.
You own BitLife, you own AI agents.
## üëÄ How BitLife works?
![img.png](docs/static/img/working_mechanism.png)
## What do we build upon Eliza?
### ‚≠ê Existing Work:
- AI16Z's Eliza: The first AI agent operating system.
- FocEliza:  a collection of Eliza plugins designed for fully on-chain AI agents.
- ElizaTEE: Implemented by Phala Network, achieving verifiable and confidential Eliza operations.

### ‚≠ê Ongoing Features:
#### plugin-BitLife-tee:
1. BitLife's smart contract implements on-chain DNA synthesis and automatic evolution based on Conway's Game of Life rules.
2. The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) mirror realizes DNA evolution program off-chain computation and on-chain verification capabilities.

plug-Character-Dynamic: The feature file dynamically updates loading plugins, enabling the automatic updating of feature files in Eliza based on specified information from the chain, achieving automated feature file updates.
plugin-Character-GreenField: Eliza writes the "Free will" information of a specified AI agent‚Äîsuch as character files, memory, and knowledge‚Äîinto, the GreenField in near real-time. If the TEE node running the specified AI agent shuts down for any reason, another TEE node can download the AI agent's "Free will" data from the chain and resume its operation.

## üí∞ If you plan to launch a token

This framework is the number one open source project on github, we are enabling the next generation of human-machine interface but we still need your help to ensure the code is of the utmost quality with response rapid to critical issues that will affect our builder community at large.

To ensure sustainable development and continued innovation, we ask contributions of 5-10% of initial token distributions from successful launches.

All contributions are publicly tracked on-chain and used exclusively for ecosystem development.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Python 2.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js 23+](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

> **Note for Windows Users:** [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) is required.

### Use the Starter (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza-starter.git
cd eliza-starter
cp .env.example .env
pnpm i && pnpm build && pnpm start
```

Once the agent is running, you should see the message to run "pnpm start:client" at the end.
Open another terminal and move to same directory and then run below command and follow the URL to chat to your agent.

```bash
pnpm start:client
```

Then read the [Documentation](https://elizaos.github.io/eliza/) to learn how to customize your Eliza.

### Manually Start Eliza (Only recommended if you know what you are doing)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git

# Checkout the latest release
# This project iterates fast, so we recommend checking out the latest release
git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)
```

### Start Eliza with Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/elizaos/eliza/tree/main)

### Edit the .env file

Copy .env.example to .env and fill in the appropriate values.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Note: .env is optional. If you're planning to run multiple distinct agents, you can pass secrets through the character JSON

### Automatically Start Eliza

This will run everything to set up the project and start the bot with the default character.

```bash
sh scripts/start.sh
```

### Edit the character file

1. Open `packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to modify the default character. Uncomment and edit.

2. To load custom characters:
    - Use `pnpm start --characters="path/to/your/character.json"`
    - Multiple character files can be loaded simultaneously
3. Connect with X (Twitter)
    - change `"clients": []` to `"clients": ["twitter"]` in the character file to connect with X

### Manually Start Eliza

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm start

# The project iterates fast, sometimes you need to clean the project if you are coming back to the project
pnpm clean
```

#### Additional Requirements

You may need to install Sharp. If you see an error when starting up, try installing it with the following command:

```
pnpm install --include=optional sharp
```
